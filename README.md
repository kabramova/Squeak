Squeak
======

> Python library for processing and analyzing data from mouse tracking
psychological experiments.

Squeak is a collection of functions developed to analyze psychological
mouse-tracking data in python.

The package is heavily commented but both functionality and documentation is
still under development.

An off-the-shelf alternative to this package is
[MouseTracker](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~freemanlab/mousetracker/).
